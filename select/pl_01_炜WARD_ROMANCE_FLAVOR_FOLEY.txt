Down a shot
burning brighter than the crowd
Dirty liquor,
thick and bitter,
from the night we so endow
Fly through the gilded streets
Rendezvous, a secret sweet
Roiling on until the dawn,
beneath the lanterns,
we’ll meet
喂(wèi), count to 3
Warm up for hide and seek
Close your eyes in amber dyes,
and don’t sneak a peek
Scarlet seams, the city shrieks
(Don’t sleep!)
Come find me
in between the smog and foley
in a never ending dream
来(lái), you’re the one
Done up in silver tongue
Pounding drums
and striking odds reflected
in song
Trip the light, the city sighs
(Tonight)
Just call for me
behind the pebbled alleyway
for stories locked in time
Strayed off
from the well-lit path
By fireflies and neon lights
we’ll dance until we die
Half hearts (As one)
Contrived (To fly)
To raise our endless night
So come on,
throw down! Let it all out
Cause a commotion,
shake the ground
Rebound and make a total scene
But darling,
slow down! Don’t be so loud
This fleeting heaven
stains the sky
in outlines only we can see
(Cut through the haze)
In days
(I stray) away
From vapid turns of scene
And through your gaze
I crave
For lives beyond the means
So darling,
come ‘round!
Don’t you die down
Our 炜(wěi)-ward romance dyes
the town loud,
spellbound, just for you and me
咦(yí)？Don’t be cheap
Watch how you look at me
If you aren’t careful,
I might think you’re the key
Scarlet scenes, the city sings
(Unseen)
Come with me
and be living, breathing,
loving in a neverending fling
Strayed off
‘tward the moonlit night
Two bodies live
and intertwined,
our heartbeats sync in time
Half hearts
(As one)
Combined
(We'll thrive)
To chase this endless night
So come on,
throw down! Let it all out
Cause a commotion,
shake the ground
Rebound and make a total scene
My darling,
come 'round! Don't you die down
Our 炜(wěi)-ward romance
dyes the town loud,
spellbound, just for you and me
Oh, throw down! Let it all out
Cause a commotion,
shake the ground
Rebound and make a total scene
But darling,
slow down! Don’t be so loud
This fleeting heaven
stains the sky
in outlines only we can see
(Cut through the haze)
In days
(I stray) away
From vapid turns of scene
And through your gaze
I crave
For lives beyond the means
So darling,
come ‘round!
Don’t you die down
Our 炜(wěi)-ward romance
dyes the town loud,
spellbound, just for you and me
Down a shot burning brighter
than the crowd
Dirty liquor,
thick and bitter,
from the night we so endow
Fly through the gilded streets
Rendezvous, a secret sweet
Roiling on until the dawn,
beneath the lanterns,
we’ll meet
​("I just didn't think
it would be Chinese, is all.")
